# Movie Recommender System

This algorithm recommends movies to a set of users using collaborative filtering (CF), a technique that is commonly used in recommender systems to predict the user ratings of items based on known ratings of related items. One effective way to implement collaborative filtering is to use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) because the learned low rank approximation of matrix factors preserves latent structure in the data while ensuring the entries retain their meaning in the context of the data. The CF-based algorithm uses a modified NMF model trained on a dataset of over 600 user preferences for almost 10,000 movies, to predict the movies in the dataset individual users would have the strongest affinity for. However, due to the extreme sparsity of the data (no user has seen all 9737 movies in the dataset), it is necessary to modify NMF because our goal is to find matrix factors whose product is less sparse than the initial matrix. Additionally, we address the problem of introducing new users to the system by creating an algorithm that will add them to the matrix factorization without needing to refactor the entire system.
